<span>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
<span>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
<span>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
<span>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
<span>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
<span>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>

<span>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
<span>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
<span>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></p><p><span>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</span></p><pre spellcheck="false" class="md-fences md-end-block ty-contain-cm modeLoaded" lang=""><div class="CodeMirror cm-s-inner CodeMirror-wrap" lang=""><div style="overflow: hidden; position: relative; width: 3px; height: 0px; top: 0px; left: 8px;"><textarea autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false" tabindex="0" style="position: absolute; bottom: -1em; padding: 0px; width: 1000px; height: 1em; outline: none;"></textarea></div><div class="CodeMirror-scrollbar-filler" cm-not-content="true"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutter-filler" cm-not-content="true"></div><div class="CodeMirror-scroll" tabindex="-1"><div class="CodeMirror-sizer" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;"><div style="position: relative; top: 0px;"><div class="CodeMirror-lines" role="presentation"><div role="presentation" style="position: relative; outline: none;"><div class="CodeMirror-measure"><pre><span>xxxxxxxxxx</span></pre></div><div class="CodeMirror-measure"></div><div style="position: relative; z-index: 1;"></div><div class="CodeMirror-code" role="presentation" style=""><div class="CodeMirror-activeline" style="position: relative;"><div class="CodeMirror-activeline-background CodeMirror-linebackground"></div><div class="CodeMirror-gutter-background CodeMirror-activeline-gutter" style="left: 0px; width: 0px;"></div><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">  To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following</span></pre></div><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">  boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"</span></pre><pre class=" CodeMirror-line " role="presentation"><span role="presentation" style="padding-right: 0.1px;">  replaced with your own identifying information.
